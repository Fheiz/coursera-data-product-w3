## Understanding Gas Mileage

### Is there any relation between factors to gas mileage (`mpg`)?

- Using the `mtcars` dataset
- studying the relationship of various factor to gas mileage

### Plot settings

- **x axis** is weight (`wt`)
- **y axis** is mileage (`mpg`)
- **color** is the number of cylinders (`cyl`)
- **size of an individual point** is the horsepower (`hp`)

## Visualizing and explore the data

```{r plot, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(plotly))
plot_ly(data = mtcars, x = ~wt, y = ~mpg, 
        color = ~as.factor(cyl), size = ~hp,
        text = ~paste("Weight: ", wt, '<br>MPG:', mpg),
        type = "scatter", mode = "markers")
```
